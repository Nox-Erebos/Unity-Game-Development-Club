# Welcome to Unity Game Development Club

This club aims to assist students who want to learn how to create video games with Unity and C#. Unity is one of the most popular game engines out there and has been used to make several high-quality games, but it still manages to be very beginner-friendly. In this club, we will explore Unity from the ground up, looking at the Unity UI system, Scripting, 2D and 3D Game Development, Physics, Animation, Sound, and more. By the end of this club, students will have the skills and confidence to make their own games with Unity.

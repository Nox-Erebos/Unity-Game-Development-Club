**Evaluation:** The club will not have any formal exams or grades. However, students will complete small assignments and a Final Project. The assignments will be based on the topics covered in each session and will require students to apply what they have learned. The Final Project will be based on the students’ game ideas and will require students to create a playable prototype of their game. The students will showcase their game to the rest of the school at the end of the year. Hopefully, this showcase will also pique other students' interest in game development.

**Expectations:** The club expects students to follow these rules and guidelines : 
**Respect** each other’s ideas, opinions, work, and feedback.
**Be Responsible** for your learning progress.
